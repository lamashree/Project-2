## Motivations for building Application
After our team brainstroming session we came in conclusion to build **Cajarilla online Marketplace**. Our team members had feeling that after developing this application  we will have enough understaing of online marketplace. All do online purchasing, ordering, and searching for the product that we need. So, as our team thought why not developing something that already exist and has large scope in the market. This application have bullied targeting to people of the society. 

## Areas for future improvements
- Login and User Authentication
-  Socket.io chat feature
- Picture file upload from local machine.
- price matching/searching
- Timer foe bids
- User posting of purchase review and picture.
- Search functionality for items
- More validation for application.
