## Motivations for building Application
After our team brainstorming session, we came in conclusion to build **Cajarilla online Marketplace**. Our team members had a feeling that after developing this application we will have enough understanding of the online marketplace. All we do online purchasing, ordering, and searching for the product that we need. So, as our team thought why not developing something that already exists and has a large scope in the market. This application has bullied targeting people of society.
## Areas for future improvements
- Login and User Authentication
-  Socket.io chat feature
- Picture file upload from local machine.
- price matching/searching
- Timer foe bids
- User posting of purchase review and picture.
- Search functionality for items
- More validation for application.
